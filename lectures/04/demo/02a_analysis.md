# Demo 2a: Literary Detective Work

**Goal:** Extract structured information from the Holmes excerpt: POS, NER, regex for dates/addresses/times; build a simple cast list and timeline.  
**Text:** Sherlock Holmes, "A Scandal in Bohemia" (~3,400 words).  
**Lecture:** Part-of-Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition, Text Extraction (Regex).

## Setup: all imports and data path

Run this cell first. We load NLTK (with required data), spaCy, and configuration from `config.yaml`. Paths and the spaCy model name are config-driven so you can switch data or model without changing code.

```python
from collections import Counter
from pathlib import Path

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import nltk
import re
import spacy
import yaml

nltk.download("punkt_tab", quiet=True)
nltk.download("averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng", quiet=True)
nltk.download("maxent_ne_chunker_tab", quiet=True)
nltk.download("words", quiet=True)

DEMO_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent if "__file__" in globals() else Path.cwd()
CONFIG_PATH = DEMO_DIR / "config.yaml"
with open(CONFIG_PATH) as f:
    CONFIG = yaml.safe_load(f)

DATA_DIR = DEMO_DIR / CONFIG["data"]["dir"]
nlp = spacy.load(CONFIG["spacy"]["model"])
```

---

## Load Holmes excerpt

We read the story excerpt and confirm its size and the first few paragraphs—this is the unstructured text we'll turn into lists of people, places, dates, and times. The file is specified in `config.yaml` (`data.files.holmes`).

```python
holmes_path = DATA_DIR / CONFIG["data"]["files"]["holmes"]
text = holmes_path.read_text(encoding="utf-8")
print(f"~{len(text.split())} words")
print(text[:600])
```

## POS tagging: NLTK

**Why it matters:** Part-of-speech tags tell us whether a word is a noun, verb, etc. Extracting all nouns gives a quick list of characters, objects, and locations without running a full NER model.

We tokenize, tag with NLTK's Penn Treebank tagset, and collect words whose tag starts with `NN` (nouns).

```python
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
tagged = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)
nouns = [w for w, t in tagged if t.startswith("NN")]
unique_nouns = list(dict.fromkeys(nouns))[:40]
print("Sample nouns (NLTK):", unique_nouns)
```

---

## POS tagging: spaCy

**Why it matters:** spaCy uses Universal Dependencies tags and runs in one pipeline. Comparing a few tokens side-by-side with NLTK shows how tag sets and tokenization can differ.

We run the full pipeline on the text and print the first 200 tokens with their coarse POS (`pos_`) and fine tag (`tag_`).

```python
doc = nlp(text)
for token in list(doc)[:200]:
    if not token.is_space:
        print(f"{token.text:15} {token.pos_:8} {token.tag_}")
```

---

## NER: NLTK (tree)

**Why it matters:** Named entity recognition finds people, organizations, and places. NLTK returns a tree; we walk it to collect labeled phrases.

We pass the POS-tagged tokens to `ne_chunk`, then extract every subtree that has a label (e.g. PERSON, ORGANIZATION).

```python
entities = nltk.ne_chunk(tagged)

def extract_entities(tree):
    out = []
    for chunk in tree:
        if hasattr(chunk, "label"):
            phrase = " ".join(c[0] for c in chunk)
            out.append((phrase, chunk.label()))
    return out

ners = extract_entities(entities)
print("NLTK NER (sample):", ners[:20])
```

---

## NER: spaCy

**Why it matters:** spaCy's NER is typically stronger out-of-the-box. We list every detected entity and its type so you can see who and where the story mentions.

Expected: Holmes, Watson, King, Irene Adler, Baker Street, Bohemia, dates.

```python
print("spaCy NER:")
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(f"  {ent.text}: {ent.label_}")
```

**Discussion:** What entities did NER miss? (e.g. "the King" may not be tagged as PERSON.) Same limitation in clinical text ("the patient").

---

## Visual: entity type counts

A bar chart of how many entities fall into each type (PERSON, GPE, DATE, etc.) makes the NER output concrete and highlights which types this text is rich in.

```python
type_counts = Counter(ent.label_ for ent in doc.ents)
labels_bar, counts_bar = zip(*type_counts.most_common())

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 3))
ax.bar(labels_bar, counts_bar, color="steelblue", edgecolor="black")
ax.set_ylabel("Count")
ax.set_title("Named entities by type (spaCy) in Holmes excerpt")
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

---

## Regex: dates

**Why it matters:** NER finds some dates, but regex lets us target exact formats—e.g. "March 20th, 1888" or numeric "3/20/1888"—which is useful for normalizing and parsing.

We use two patterns: one for month name + optional ordinal + year (e.g. "March 20th, 1888"), one for "ordinal of Month, year" (e.g. "twentieth of March, 1888"), and one for numeric `MM/DD/YYYY`.

```python
months = r"(January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December)"
date_long = re.findall(
    rf"\b{months}\s+\w+(?:st|nd|rd|th)?,?\s*(\d{{4}})\b",
    text,
    re.IGNORECASE,
)
date_ordinal_of = re.findall(
    rf"\b(\w+)\s+of\s+{months},?\s*(\d{{4}})\b",
    text,
    re.IGNORECASE,
)
print("Long-form dates (Month DD, YYYY):", date_long)
print("Ordinal of Month, YYYY:", date_ordinal_of)

date_numeric = re.findall(r"\b\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}/\d{4}\b", text)
print("Numeric dates:", date_numeric)
```

---

## Regex: addresses

**Why it matters:** Addresses follow syntactic patterns (number + street name + type). Regex can pull them out even when NER doesn't tag them as a single span.

We look for a number (optionally with a letter, e.g. 221B) followed by words and a street-type keyword.

```python
addresses = re.findall(
    r"\b(\d+[A-Za-z]?\s+[\w\s]+(?:Street|Street,|Lane|Road|Avenue))\b",
    text,
)
print("Address-like:", addresses)
```

---

## Regex: times

**Why it matters:** Expressions like "quarter to eight" or "half-past eleven" are easy to match with a small set of patterns and complement date extraction for a timeline.

```python
times = re.findall(
    r"\b(quarter\s+(?:past|to)\s+\w+|\d+\s*o\'?clock|half[- ]?past\s+\w+)\b",
    text,
    re.IGNORECASE,
)
print("Times:", times)
```

---

## Combine: cast list and timeline

We bring together the extracted entities and regex results into a simple "cast" (people and places) and a short timeline (dates and times). This is the kind of structured summary you might feed into a database or dashboard.

```python
people = sorted(set(ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ == "PERSON"))
places = sorted(set(ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ in ("GPE", "LOC", "ORG")))
print("Cast (people):", people[:15])
print("Places/orgs:", places[:10])

timeline = []
timeline.extend([f"Date: {m[0]} {m[1]}" for m in date_long])
timeline.extend([f"Date: {m[1]} {m[2]} ({m[0]})" for m in date_ordinal_of])
timeline.extend([f"Time: {t}" for t in times])
print("Timeline:", timeline)
```
