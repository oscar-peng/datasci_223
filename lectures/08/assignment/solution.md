# Assignment 8: Murder Mystery Agents

Build detective agent workflows that solve two murder mysteries using the OpenAI Agents SDK. You'll use **prompt chaining** — the workflow pattern from the lecture — where each agent handles one stage of the investigation and passes structured results to the next.

## Setup

```python
%pip install -q openai>=1.0.0 openai-agents>=0.1.0 python-dotenv>=1.0.0 pydantic>=2.0.0
```

```python
%reset -f

import os
import json
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from IPython.display import display, HTML
from agents import Agent, ModelSettings, Runner, function_tool, set_tracing_disabled
from agents.models.openai_chatcompletions import OpenAIChatCompletionsModel

load_dotenv()
os.makedirs("output", exist_ok=True)

# Same setup pattern as the demos: explicit model object + settings
set_tracing_disabled(True)

if os.environ.get("OPENROUTER_API_KEY"):
    client = AsyncOpenAI(
        api_key=os.environ["OPENROUTER_API_KEY"],
        base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    )
    AGENTS_MODEL = OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(model="openai/gpt-4o-mini", openai_client=client)
elif os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
    client = AsyncOpenAI(api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])
    AGENTS_MODEL = OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(model="gpt-4o-mini", openai_client=client)
else:
    raise ValueError("Set OPENROUTER_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY in .env")

SETTINGS = ModelSettings(temperature=0, max_tokens=4096)

print("Setup complete")
```

## Display Helpers

Rich display functions imported from `helpers.py` — styled evidence cards, chat bubbles, detective notes, and verdict panels that make the investigation output visually engaging.

```python
from helpers import (
    case_briefing, display_stage, display_search, display_interrogation,
    display_notes, display_witness, display_verdict,
)
```

## Transcript Logger

Captures what the detective agents do — which tools they call and what they learn.

```python
transcript = []

def log_action(action_type: str, detail: str):
    """Append an entry to the investigation transcript. Rich display is handled by the tool functions themselves."""
    transcript.append({"action": action_type, "detail": detail})
```

# Part 1: Murder at the Mountain Cabin

A group of old college friends reunited at a remote mountain cabin. By Saturday morning, the host — Marcus Reed — was found dead. The cabin is snowed in. The killer is among the guests.

You'll build a **three-stage investigation workflow** using prompt chaining:

1. **Crime Scene Investigation** — An agent searches all locations and summarizes the evidence
2. **Suspect Interrogation** — An agent uses the evidence to conduct targeted interviews
3. **Final Deduction** — An agent analyzes everything and makes the accusation

Each stage produces structured output (`output_type`) that feeds into the next — the same chaining pattern from Demo 3.

```python
with open("mystery_data.json") as f:
    cabin_data = json.load(f)

case_briefing(
    title=cabin_data["title"],
    setting=cabin_data["setting"],
    victim_name=cabin_data["victim"]["name"],
    cause=cabin_data["victim"]["cause_of_death"],
    suspects=[c["name"] + " — " + c["role"] for c in cabin_data["characters"].values()],
    locations=[loc["name"] for loc in cabin_data["locations"].values()],
)
```

### Part 1 Tools

These tools let agents interact with the mystery world. `search_location` returns clues from a location. `interrogate` creates a temporary sub-agent for each suspect — the suspect has its own personality and secrets embedded in a system prompt, so it responds in character.

```python
@function_tool
def search_location(location_id: str) -> str:
    """Search a location in the cabin for clues. Valid locations: living_room, kitchen, mudroom, upstairs_hallway, back_porch, marcus_bedroom"""
    location = cabin_data["locations"].get(location_id)
    if not location:
        return f"Unknown location '{location_id}'. Valid: {', '.join(cabin_data['locations'].keys())}"
    log_action("search", f"Searched {location['name']}")
    display_search(location["name"], location["clues"])
    result = f"**{location['name']}**: {location['description']}\n\nClues found:\n"
    for clue in location["clues"]:
        result += f"- {clue}\n"
    return result


@function_tool
async def interrogate(character_name: str, question: str) -> str:
    """Interrogate a suspect by name. Ask them a specific question. Valid names: diana, larry, tom, sofia"""
    key = character_name.lower().strip()
    character = cabin_data["characters"].get(key)
    if not character:
        return f"Unknown character '{character_name}'. Valid: {', '.join(cabin_data['characters'].keys())}"

    log_action("interrogate", f"Asked {character['name']}: {question[:80]}")

    system_prompt = f"""You are {character['name']}, {character['role']} in a murder investigation.

Personality: {character['personality']}
Background: {character['background']}
Your secret: {character['secret']}

{chr(10).join('- ' + k for k in character['knows'])}

Behavioral guidelines: {character['guardrails']}

Stay in character. Answer the detective's question based on your knowledge, personality, and secrets. Keep responses to 2-4 sentences. You may lie or deflect according to your behavioral guidelines."""

    suspect_agent = Agent(
        name=character["name"],
        model=AGENTS_MODEL,
        model_settings=SETTINGS,
        instructions=system_prompt,
    )
    result = await Runner.run(suspect_agent, question)
    response = result.final_output
    log_action("response", f"{character['name']}: {response[:100]}")
    display_interrogation(character["name"], question, response)
    return response

cabin_tools = [search_location, interrogate]
print(f"Tools ready: {[t.name for t in cabin_tools]}")
```

### Part 1 Structured Outputs

Each stage produces structured data that feeds into the next.

```python
class EvidenceSummary(BaseModel):
    """Stage 1 output: what the crime scene investigation found."""
    clues: list[str]
    suspicious_items: list[str]
    key_questions: list[str]

class InterviewFindings(BaseModel):
    """Stage 2 output: what the interrogations revealed."""
    alibis: list[str]
    contradictions: list[str]
    key_observations: list[str]

class Accusation(BaseModel):
    """Stage 3 output: the final accusation."""
    killer: str
    weapon: str
    motive: str
    evidence: list[str]
```

### TODO 1: Stage 1 — Crime Scene Investigation

Create an agent that searches all six locations and summarizes the evidence.

```python
display_stage(1, "Crime Scene Investigation", "Searching all locations for physical evidence and clues")
transcript = []  # Reset transcript for Part 1

search_agent = Agent(
    name="Crime Scene Investigator",
    model=AGENTS_MODEL,
    model_settings=SETTINGS,
    instructions="You are a crime scene investigator. Search ALL six locations for clues: living_room, kitchen, mudroom, upstairs_hallway, back_porch, marcus_bedroom. After searching all locations, summarize what you found.",
    tools=[search_location],
    output_type=EvidenceSummary,
)
search_result = await Runner.run(search_agent, "Search all six locations in the cabin for evidence.", max_turns=15)
evidence = search_result.final_output

    "Suspicious items": evidence.suspicious_items,
    "Questions to investigate": evidence.key_questions,

```

### TODO 2: Stage 2 — Suspect Interrogation

Create an agent that uses the evidence from Stage 1 to interrogate suspects.

```python
display_stage(2, "Suspect Interrogation", "Questioning suspects based on crime scene evidence")

evidence_brief = f"""Evidence found so far:
Clues: {chr(10).join('- ' + c for c in evidence.clues)}

    instructions=f"""You are a detective interrogating murder suspects. You have evidence from the crime scene.

{evidence_brief}

1. Ask about their alibi and whereabouts during the murder
2. Follow up on anything suspicious — if their answer seems evasive, contradicts the physical evidence, or doesn't explain a suspicious item, press them with a second question

After all interviews, summarize your findings including alibis, contradictions, and key observations.""",
    tools=[interrogate],
    output_type=InterviewFindings,
)
interview_result = await Runner.run(interview_agent, "Interrogate all four suspects based on the evidence.", max_turns=25)
findings = interview_result.final_output

display_notes("Interrogation Summary", {
    "Alibis": findings.alibis,
    "Contradictions": findings.contradictions,
    "Key observations": findings.key_observations,
})
```

### TODO 3: Stage 3 — Final Deduction

Create an agent that takes ALL evidence and makes the final accusation.

```python
display_stage(3, "Final Deduction", "Analyzing all evidence to identify the killer")

case_file = f"""{evidence_brief}

Interview findings:
Alibis: {chr(10).join('- ' + a for a in findings.alibis)}

deduction_agent = Agent(
    name="Lead Detective",
    model=AGENTS_MODEL,
    model_settings=SETTINGS,
    instructions="""You are a lead detective making your final accusation. Analyze all evidence systematically:
- Physical evidence cannot lie — muddy boots, wiped fingerprints, moved objects tell the true story
- Compare each suspect's stated alibi against the physical evidence — whose alibi is CONTRADICTED?
- Identify the murder weapon from crime scene evidence (what was wiped clean? what caused the injury?)
- Determine motive from the victim's documents, texts, and journal entries
The suspect whose alibi is most clearly contradicted by physical evidence is the killer.""",
    output_type=Accusation,
)
deduction_result = await Runner.run(deduction_agent, f"Based on all evidence, make your accusation:\n\n{case_file}", max_turns=3)
accusation = deduction_result.final_output

display_verdict("ACCUSATION", {
    "Killer": accusation.killer,
    "Weapon": accusation.weapon,
    "Motive": accusation.motive,
    "Evidence": ", ".join(accusation.evidence),
})
```

### Save Part 1 Results

```python
part1_results = {

# Part 2: Death at St. Mercy Hospital

A structured logic puzzle. Dr. Eleanor Voss was found dead in her office. Security footage shows no one entered or left overnight — the killer was already inside. Use deduction tools to analyze evidence and identify the killer, weapon, and time of death.

```python
with open("mystery_o_matic.json") as f:
    hospital_data = json.load(f)

case_briefing(
    title=hospital_data["title"],
    setting=hospital_data["setting"],
    victim_name=hospital_data["victim"]["name"],
    cause=hospital_data["victim"]["cause_of_death"],
    suspects=[s["name"] + " — " + s["role"] for s in hospital_data["suspects"].values()],
)
```

### Part 2 Tools

Deduction tools that give the agent access to different categories of evidence.

```python
@function_tool
def get_room_map() -> str:
    """Get the hospital floor map showing all rooms and their locations."""
    log_action("tool", "Retrieved room map")
    result = "Hospital Floor Map:\n"

        result += f"\n{floor.replace('_', ' ').title()}: {', '.join(rooms)}"
    return result


@function_tool
def get_witness_statement(suspect: str) -> str:
    """Get a suspect's statement and background. Valid suspects: dr_blake, nurse_chen, dr_santos, orderly_james"""
    key = suspect.lower().strip().replace(" ", "_").replace("dr.", "dr").replace("dr ", "dr_")
    suspect_data = hospital_data["suspects"].get(key)
    if not suspect_data:
        return f"Unknown suspect '{suspect}'. Valid: {', '.join(hospital_data['suspects'].keys())}"
    log_action("interview", f"Got statement from {suspect_data['name']}")
    display_witness(suspect_data['name'], suspect_data['role'], suspect_data['statement'])

    for obs in hospital_data["evidence"]["witness_statements"]:
        result += f"- {obs['witness']}: {obs['statement']}\n"
    return result


@function_tool
def get_weapons() -> str:
    """Get information about potential murder weapons found or available in the hospital."""
    log_action("tool", "Retrieved weapons analysis")
    result = "=== WEAPONS ANALYSIS ===\n"
    for weapon_id, weapon in hospital_data["weapons"].items():
        result += f"\n**{weapon_id.replace('_', ' ').title()}**: {weapon['description']}\n"

    return result

hospital_tools = [get_room_map, get_witness_statement, get_evidence, get_weapons, get_rules]
print(f"Tools ready: {[t.name for t in hospital_tools]}")

### TODO 4: Solve the Hospital Mystery

Like Part 1, this uses a two-stage workflow: first gather all evidence, then deduce the answer.

```python
